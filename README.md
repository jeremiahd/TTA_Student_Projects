This repository holds my student projects from The Tech Academy.  I tried to keep this organized as I went through each course, but at the time, it was difficult to tell what projects were throw away exercises, while some bloomed into bigger coding projects.

Overview - This folder is from the Overview of Software Development course.  There are a few examples of sorting algorithms, a simple web page, and a dozen or so Small Basic exercises.

HTMLCSS - This folder is from the HTML5 and CSS3 course.  The final project from this class is in my jeremiahd.github.io. repository, as it is hosted by github.  It can be viewed at https://jeremiahd.github.io.
